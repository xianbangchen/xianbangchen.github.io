*Developing AI-based control methods for greenhouse energy systems in the context of controlled-environment agriculture. The goal is to enhance the economics (improve profits) and resilience (be stronger against extreme cases) of the greenhouse facilities.* [Read More »](/research/Project_05_CEA_Cornell/)
